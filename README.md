Hi, I’m Joanofarc Xavier, an independant researcher with a robust background in advanced control system design, cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques.In my PhD research I worked on a challenging multi-disciplinary topic – ‘Nonlinear system Identification, nonlinearity quantification and control of Nonlinear Systems’, where 
I integrated the concepts of Nonlinear Control systems design from Electrical Engineering, time series analysis from Machine learning/deep learning algorithms and 
applied it to control engineering problems in Process reactors. This experience honed my skills in analysing large datasets, applying rigorous quantitative methods, and 
developing new approaches to complex problems. 
I have designed and executed multiple projects, collaborated with faculty, and mentored students on advanced topics in control systems and Machine learning.My track
record of high-impact journal articles published in SCI indexed publications in the topics of machine learning, deep learning and Nonlinear control is available at
https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=4O4FHQMAAAAJ&hl=en .
I’m currently working on  Reinforecement learning for time- series analysis and closed loop control of Physical systems.
